# Markup Language

A markup language is a system for annotating text to define the structure, formatting, and presentation of documents on the internet. It uses tags or codes to indicate the purpose or function of different elements within the document, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Markup languages, like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), provide a standardized way to structure and display content across various platforms and web browsers.

Examples of markup languages include:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The most widely used markup language for creating web pages and applications. It specifies the structure and presentation of content on the internet.
2. XML (eXtensible Markup Language): A flexible markup language that allows users to define their own tags and structure data. It is commonly used for storing and transporting data between different systems.
3. Markdown: Although not a traditional markup language, Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting and styling plain text, particularly for creating content for the web.
4. LaTeX: A markup language commonly used in academia and scientific publishing for typesetting documents. It provides extensive control over the layout and formatting of mathematical equations and complex technical documents.
