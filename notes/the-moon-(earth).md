# The Moon (Earth)

Earth's only natural satellite. Orbits around the Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi).

The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply _Moon_. Occasionally, the name **Luna** is used in scientific writing and science fiction to distinguish our moon from others. **Cynthia** is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess, while **Selene** (literally "Moon") is the Greek goddess of the Moon.
