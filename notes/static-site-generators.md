# Static Site Generators

Static site generators (SSGs) are engines that use text input files (such as [[markdown|Markdown]], [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html), and [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/)) to generate static web pages. SSGs are typically for rarely-changing, informative content, such as product pages, news websites, (software) documentation, manuals, and blogs.

Popular choices in SSGs include:

-   [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
-   [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
-   [[zola|Zola]]
