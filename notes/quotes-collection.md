## G. K. Chesterton

> It is really not so repulsive to see the poor asking for money as to see the rich asking for more money. And advertisement is the rich asking for more money. A man would be annoyed if he found himself in a mob of millionaires, all holding out their silk hats for a penny; or all shouting with one voice, "Give me money." Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout would assault the ear. "Budge's Boots are the Best" simply means "Give me money"; "Use Seraphic Soap" simply means "Give me money." It is a complete mistake to suppose that common people make our towns commonplace, with unsightly things like advertisements. Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy gentlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes. They disfigure their towns in order to decorate their houses.

## u/kaidomac On ADHD

> "I wish I had the ability to instantly internalize this comic for neuro-typical people. "Just try harder" doesn't fully illuminate the ridiculous, daily, momentary inner struggle we fight ALL the time. And it also helps SO MUCH to explain it to ourselves this way!
>
> I was visiting an elderly family member the other day and they were like, "Well I definitely don't have ADHD, when I decide to focus on something, I can just do it!" I definitely had a momentary inner twinge that that's not the norm for me…simply deciding to do it & not having the "Mentos & Coke" effect of mental diffusion kick in to over-think the task & then feel all of the other things I have to do start swirling around, and then feel the emotional barriers of the weight of the task & the mental energy loss from the pre-requisite requirements like having to clean up or find stuff kick in…things that aren't on anybody's normal radar at all!

> "We humans do not understand compassion. In each moment of our lives, we betray it. Aye, we know of its worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned. Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the word. It must be given freely. In abundance."

> "I've been called worse, and I'm disappointed you couldn't think of something better."

## XKCD Book

> **Throwing is hard.**
>
> "In order to deliver a baseball to a batter, a pitcher has to release the ball at exactly the right point in the throw. A timing error of half a millisecond in either direction is enough to cause the ball to miss the strike zone.
>
> To put that in perspective, it takes about five milliseconds for the fastest nerve impulse to travel the length of the arm. That means that when your arm is still rotating toward the correct position, the signal to release the ball is already at your wrist.
>
> In terms of timing, this is like a drummer dropping a drumstick from the tenth story and hitting a drum on the ground on the correct beat."
> From XKCD Book
