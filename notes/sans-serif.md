# Sans-serif

In typography and lettering, a "sans-serif", "sans serif", "gothic", or simply "sans" letterform is one that does not have extending features called "serifs" at the end of strokes. Sans-serif typefaces tend to have less stroke width variation than serif typefaces. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.
