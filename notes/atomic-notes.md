# Atomic Notes

Atomic notes are single, self-contained notes that capture a single idea or piece of information. They are meant to be read and understood without needing to refer to anything more.

They can be connected to another atomic note or idea in some way. By breaking down complex ideas into smaller, atomic notes, one can make their notes more organized and easier to review later.
