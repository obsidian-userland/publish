## Getting Started

Within your vault, create `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Site Title</title>
    <meta name="description" itemprop="about" content="Site description." />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@obsidian-userland/publish/dist/index.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script>
      const app = new Obsidian({
        mainPage: "homepage",
        title: `Site Title`,
        target: document.querySelector("#root"),
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then start a static server to preview the site:

<!-- python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 # deprecated, use next line -->

```bash
python -m http.server 3000
# Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
```

By default, `README.md` will be loaded as the main page. If you want to set another file as main page, just set the `mainPage` option to the file name (without the `.md` extension):

```diff
const app = new Obsidian({
+ mainPage: 'homepage', // means `homepage.md`
  title: `your title`,
  target: document.querySelector('#root')
})
```

## Limitations

This project hasn't been updated in around 2 years. There are some known limitations.

### 1. Folders are not currently supported

Obsidian will automatically find the notes in folder. For example if `Hello.md` is in `docs/Hello`, you can still use `[[Hello]]` to link it instead of declarating the folder name (like `[[docs/Hello]]`, unless file name conflict).

This project doesn't handle this yet. If you have file `Hello.md` in `/docs` but using `[[Hello]]`, it only find the `/Hello.md` instead of `/docs/Hello.md`.

So keep all notes flat within a directory/folder.

### 2. References are not currently supported

It needs compilation to find the references of the notes. In order to keep it simple, we don't support this yet.
